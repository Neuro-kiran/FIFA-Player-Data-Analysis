## Overview

This project is focused on working with FIFA player data to perform various data analysis tasks using Python and pandas. The operations covered in this README include filtering players based on different criteria, retrieving specific player records, and calculating country-wise averages of player characteristics.

## Data Operations

### Loading the Data

The dataset used in this project is loaded from an external source. We read the data using the pandas library to perform various operations on it.

### Filtering Players by Age

We filter players based on their age, selecting players younger than 20 and older than 30.

### Filtering Players by Value

We filter players based on their market value, selecting players whose value falls within a specified range.

### Filtering Players by Skill Moves

We filter players based on their skill moves, selecting players with a skill rating of 5.0.

### Getting the Record of Neymar Jr

We retrieve the record of the player "Neymar Jr" from the dataset.

### Country-Wise Averages

We calculate and display country-wise averages for player height and weight.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the pandas library installed. You can install pandas using pip:
